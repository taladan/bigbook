# The Big Book of Small Python Projects

In this repository you will find all the pertinent code exercises I've completed from [Al Sweigart's](https://inventwithpython.com) freely available (online) book [The Big Book of Small Python Projects](https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython).

Inevitably some if not most of the code will be different from the code contained within the book's examples - this is by design.  I am slowly working my way toward exploring programming with Python and having finished the bulk of [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com), I find my interest in the language piqued, and wish to continue learning.  I find Al's method (mostly) comprehensible as it takes a more hands-on approach of seeing, doing, changing and exploring instead of dry, meaningless examples about apples and oranges that have no real affect or impact on the things I am interested in pursuing.  This is not a commentary on the other tutorials and teachers that exist out there, simply a statement that my learning style, for a short while, seems to conform somewhat more easily to Al's teaching style.  There are shortcomings in his books and methodologies, no doubt, however this is true of any teacher - no one is perfect, afterall.  

# License

If you have come this far and wish to fiddle with any of this code, you are freely allowed to copy and reuse any of this code for any reason, it is available to you, and I have no qualms about you using it.  As such, I suppose you'll want licensing information:  This repo and the code contained within it is released under the GPLv3 license.  For more information, see the file marked LICENSE.

# Questions?

If you have any questions about any of this code or any other I've released, please feel free to contact me at taladan AT gmail.com, I am available for chat most days, and would happily discuss any questions you have about my reasoning behind doing anything a particular way, or any other questions you might have.

# Answers?

If you come across an issue in the code, please don't hesitate to file an issue - this helps me improve my coding ability and the code I release to the wild, which in turn helps you have better software to run (even if it is just simple text based games!) This cycle of synergistic reciprocity can only improve the world!


Thanks for taking the time to read the README, and have a wonderful day!
